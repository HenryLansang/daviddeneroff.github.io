        <p id="blogp1"> For this blog, I want to look at a tech issue that also applies to me and my cohort as we prepare for phase 1: burnout. I read a number of articles about burnout with coders due to long hours and difficult projects, so I thought it would be nice to explore this issue a bit further and show two popular solutions to this undesirable problem.<br>
<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2"> The first solution is to take pride in working with your team, an idea that definitely translates to phase 1 of DBC. While working, it can be easy to become overwhelmed personally, but adopting a team mentality can definitely help us get through any obstacles we face. Additionally, being an active memeber of the team who checks in on others who are having a rough time and asks for help when they need it will greatly help the team dynamics.</p>
        <p> The second solution to avoiding burnout involved looking for new challenges and ways to stay stimulated. Have you been working on something and the hours just fly by without you noticing? People who manage to get themselves into exciting working environments can often describe working in that way. Finding new ways to be stimulated by what your working on can not only keep you engaged in your work, but may even make you more productive. </p>
        <p>Burnout is a real issue and DBC might push some of us to the edge of burnout, so I hope we all use some of the solutions available to us so we can turn burnout into a postive way to continue programming.</p>
