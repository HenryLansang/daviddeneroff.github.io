        <p id="blogp1">I really like pairing when taking on challenges and have been doing it much more than required. Once the introductions are over, pairing allowed me to think out loud, and I found that really helped me when I was struggling through topics. When I hit a minor snag, I could quickly voice my concern and move past it which can be more difficult when I’m working independently. Often my pairing parter would also have questions, and trying to explain concepts really helped to strengthen my understanding of what I was explaining, so there is definitely a mutual benefit to asking questions. It’s fun to sit down with someone else, either face to face or via video chats, and push each other to get through a challenge. It’s such a great feeling to run well written, properly running code. The frustrations I have had with pairing have happened when my partner is not really contributing to the team effort. This has been an infrequent occurrence, but I do need to feel that we’re working together and I have a tough time when things are heavily one sided.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2">I enjoyed reading the feedback from my pairs. I like to see if there are things I’m doing that are helping the group, but I really want to know if there’s something I’m doing that can be altered for better results in the future. My feedback so far has allowed me to better embrace being a beginner!! I can be tough on myself when I’m not sure what to do next, and the feedback has given me a lot of confidence to slow down and take the time to learn these skills that are so new to me. The feedback validates the work I’m putting into the phase 0 while navigating me towards improving, which I really appreciate. <!--blog paragraph2--> </p>
        <p> Writing feedback has been mostly enjoyable, but I do have problems voicing substantial criticisms of others. Without realizing it, I think that getting feedback sounds like a scary thing because it means that someone is going to tell you something that you can improve upon. I have found the DBC community to be outrageously supportive, and I am very happy to constructive criticism especially given how kind everyone has been in the way they provide that criticism. </p><br><br><br>
