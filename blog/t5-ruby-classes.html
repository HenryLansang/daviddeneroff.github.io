        <p id="blogp1">This week’s work with classes gave me a greater insight into how object oriented design works. And, naturally, it got me thinking about my elevator. For a few days this week, my apartment became an 11 story walk up. Not saying that it’s been a prevalent thought in my mind, but that fact that I’m writing about it in my blog should speak volumes. Within an object oriented language like ruby, an object is essentially a way of containing information and the way objects communicate with each other is extremely important. Classes allow you to make your own object and determine how they interact with other objects. So, the only logical solution is that my elevator broke down so that I could better understand the importance of classes in Ruby…at least that’s what I keep telling myself.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2"> The elevator can be divided into a number of separate entities: the gears, the cabin, the electrical work, and so forth. You can think of each one of these elements as a class. The gears have certain things that work to make the move in the right way, or methods in ruby talk. Those methods change the way the data contained in the object moves. Now there are going to be some elements of the gears class that need to talk to more than just one method. But how on earth can we solve this problem? Fear not, that’s where instance variables come into play. These variables transcend classes and work throughout any method in the class. The scope of methods is endless as they can work only on a specific method or globally, effecting the entire code. While it is useful to know about the scope of each variable, keep in mind that the larger you go, the harder it becomes to keep track of what your variable is doing, so make sure you can justify going with something with an incredibly large scope, like a global variable.<!--blog paragraph2--> </p>
        <p>Classes allow you to create gret programs because they can interact with other objects. When all of your objects work together, you have a fully functional, awesome program you can be proud of!! Otherwise, you’ll be walking up a lot of stairs.</p><br><br><br>
