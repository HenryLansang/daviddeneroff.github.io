For me, the most exciting things about DBC are also the things that make me the most nervous, but I think that’s a good thing. I like the idea of being thrown into coding with, as Shereef puts it, an apron on and a wrench in hand. I like doing and trying new things, so I’m really enthusiastic about the environment DBC actively creates. With the hands on approach, I’m nervous that I’ll be overwhelmed by the extremely large scope of web design. The scope, ironically, is also one of elements I find most exciting about web design. I hope working at DBC will allow me to approach the field of web development with confidence and enthusiasm.

I definitely see how easy it is to fall into the restaurant mentality and I’m glad Shereef highlights the preferred kitchen mentality in his video. I get the impression that DBC is an organized place that allows for a ton of deviation. The kitchen mentality seems to have enormous benefits, most notably that students take an active role in their learning process and making sure that they are getting the most out of their time at DBC. I commend DBC ability to create a place where students are learning a ton of information in a very short period of time while still granting them the freedom to make the experience their own.

There are a number of short, intensive programs to learn how to code, and the reason I chose DBC was because of their unique philosophy that focuses more on how to learn new technologies than how to learn certain technologies. Theoretically, I feel that I can engage very positively in this type of culture, but obviously there will be a lot of things that are challenging. I think the most important thing for me is to continue to challenge and push myself while at the same time maintaining a sense of balance, which will definitely be easier said then done. I’m really excited to be apart of such a hands on program.
