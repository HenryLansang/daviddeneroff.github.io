            <h2> Stereotype Threat<!--Entry title --></h2>
        <p> <!--date-->11/16/14</p>

        <br>
        <p id="blogp1">Stereotype threat shows that there is a relationship between expected results and an individual’s achievement. Anyone can be vulnerable to stereotype threat, and I have definitely felt it while learning to code with DBC. Like many of the people in my cohort and DBC in general, I have no background in computer programming. Transitioning from my liberal arts degree in English and Philosophy to the tech world has often left me wondering if I am making the right decision for myself. Programming was such a foreign concept to me that I was hesitant to tell my friends what I was doing. I felt embarrassed to be taking on something so new and even though I knew this feeling was overblown in my mind, I couldn’t help feeling that way.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2"> My fear stemmed from not knowing if I would be good at this new skill and how embarrassing that might be. Especially in the earlier weeks of Phase 0, I found that when I would work through a challenge by myself and get stuck I would immediately start questioning myself, wondering if I was wasting my time. When in those moments, I didn’t have the eagerness and excitement that I may have otherwise had, but instead I was trying not to ruin everything and just get through the challenge. In other words, I couldn’t enjoy myself anymore. Stereotype threat told me that because of my educational background I couldn’t possibly be taking on the challenges of computer programming. At times, unfortunately, I believed that truth even though it has not yet been the case.<!--blog paragraph2--> </p>
        <p>Time has definitely helped me get past the stereotype threat, but it does still persist. One thing I have found extremely helpful is working with others. I get together with a partner or two and we just sit in a coffee shop and work on our codes. It helps me to see that other people need to look things up and at times struggle to know how to approach a problem. It reminds me that I am in a group of people with similar skills to me, and that helps calm me down. Despite the positive steps taken over the last few weeks, I am definitely still too quick to panic when I am stuck. I enjoy a challenge and learning new things, so it’s really important that I get over the stereotype threat that comes with my DBC experience and embrace challenges and enjoy figuring things out. It is only then that I can really learn how to work well and be comfortable with my new skills.</p><br><br><br>
