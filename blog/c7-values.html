        <p id="blogp1">I chose adventure as a word I associate with personal happiness and satisfaction. Adventure has been an extremely important component of life as I like throwing myself into new and challenging experiences and figuring my way out of them. When in a real adventure, I love how engaged I become with what I am doing. I seem to forget about all the distractions around me and completely immerse myself in that moment. I get joy from the adventure itself, of course, but more so from proving that I can be in that type of situation and figure my way out.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2"> Although I chose adventure from the list of words given, the other main contenders were challenge, confidence, enthusiasm, free time, inner harmony, and persistence. Ranked 0-5, I would say I’m generally pretty good at living up to those values, giving myself a 4 or 5. I try to keep close tabs on myself and make sure I’m enjoying what I’m doing. There are so many wonderful experiences to have that I try my hardest to engage with the things I love. This doesn’t mean working hard is out of the equation, but rather make sure you’re working on something that’s going to contribute to your wellbeing. I find that when I’m involved in something I enjoy, I live up to many of those values on my list, whereas when I’m forcing myself to do something I have to work a lot harder to uphold them. I feel that often we can get caught in a mindset that tells us to do x then y then z, and I think it’s really important to evaluate why you’re doing those things and find your own path if you don’t like the answer.<!--blog paragraph2--> </p>
        <p>When I look at the values, I realize that most of them are internal while stereotype threat is external. When I start to feel stereotype threat, I think it’s really important that I look inward and try to assess what I feel personally. If I rely on external pressures, not only am I not going to get anywhere, I am not going to enjoy learning to code. In addition to looking to myself, I’m very happy to say that I can look to the DBC community. Of course I will have people I’m closer to than others, but the community itself is extremely supportive, so I hope to use that support to help me if I am in a rut.</p><br><br><br>
