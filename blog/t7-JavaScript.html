        <p id="blogp1">We’ve been working with Ruby for a while now, and frankly it’s clear, readable syntax has spoiled me. I’ve come to believe that all coding would be like this and then wham, enter JavaScript. All the neat, clean code of Ruby has been replaced by a myriad of semicolons and curly braces. However, despite the syntactical differences, there is actually a lot of similarity between the languages. I find that Ruby has given me a strong conceptual framework that allows me to approach JavaScript problems, and the main challenge comes from expressing my thoughts in this new language.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2"> The transition from Ruby to JavaScript is a lot like going from a native language to a foreign one. For example to describe a house as “la casa blanca” in spanish makes perfect sense, but literally translating that to english as “the house white” doesn’t quite cut it. While our human capacities allow us to understand such a mistake, the rigidity of the computer can be more unforgiving so learning the proper way to express yourself is of paramount importance. Again, it is important to realize that our backgrounds in Ruby have already armed us with the tools to think through what we want (we want do describe a house as white), we just need to learn how to express ourselves correctly.
<!--blog paragraph2--> </p>
        <p>While Ruby generally has an easier syntax to understand, one area that I find to be very manageable in JavaScript is looping. In Ruby, we have loops like while, until, each, map, times with options to include do. Frankly, the list was exhausting and I found it to be very difficult to know what to use when. In JavaScript, there are only two main looping structures, each with an optional modification. We’ll introduce them one by, showing their differences and functionality.</p>
        <p>When you know how many times you want to loop through a block of code, it’s time for a for loop. The syntax is as follows:</p>
        <p>for (statement 1; statement 2; statement 3;)
{ <br>code block <br>
}</p>
        <p>for (i = 0; i < 4; i++) { <br>
    console.log(i) <br>
}</p>
        <p>In the second instance, the code allows us to count up from 0 to 4, logging the numbers to the console after each integer increase. </p>
        <p>We can also use the for/in format, again when we’re performing a loop when we know how many times we want to loop. This is just a modified version of the for loop.</p>
        <p>for (variable in object) { <br>
code block <br>
}</p>
        <p>var list = {a:1, b:2, c:3}; <br>
for (var prop in list) { <br>
console.log(prop + list[prop]}; <br>
};</p>
        <p>So for loops are working great, but what happens if we don’t know how many times we want to loop? That’s when our while loops come into play. While loops continue to loop until a condition is met. It is important to make sure that you include a way for the loop to break, otherwise you will create an infinite loop that will crash your browser. Here is an example of a while loop:</p>
        <p>while(condition) { <br>
code block <br>
};</p>
        <p>var x = 4 <br>
while(x < 10) { <br>
console.log(x); <br>
x++; <br>
}</p>
        <p>Without the x++ in the last example, the code would create an infinite loop because x with it’s assigned value of 4 will always be less than 10.</p>
        <p>We’re almost there, just one more modification of the while loop, and that’s do/while. This just means that we’re going to loop through at least once no matter whether the condition is true or not.</p>
        <p>do { <br>
code block <br>
} while (condition)</p>
        <p>var notTrue = false; <br>
do { <br>
console.log(“still gonna run”); <br>
} while (notTrue)</p>
        <p>Although there’s a lot of text here, the two types of loops in JavaScript are for loops and while loops. We use for loops when we know how many times we’re looping, while loops when we don’t know how many times we’ll be looping.</p>
