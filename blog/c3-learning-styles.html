        <p id="blogp1">My Gregoric Thinking Style quiz showed I fall into the abstract random thinkers category, a group that “organize[s] information through reflection, and thrive[s] in unstructured, people-oriented environments.” From this brief definition of abstract random thinking I immediately see a lot potential overlap between my Gregoric style and DBC. The learning space in DBC obviously gets students through an unbelievable amount of information, but it also grants students a lot of freedom and space to work. Additionally, the emphasis on pairing and group work lends itself to the "people-oriented environment" component of my learning style.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2">The biggest struggles I have had with the DBC work thus far have been largely self-inflicted. Sometimes when I stuck on a problem I'll start to really doubt myself and my ability to complete the work. I've started to use the pairing sessions more effectively to help me get past those bumps in the road, and that's definitely something I want to continue doing. I find that just reaching out to people when I'm struggling really helps calm me down and refocus my approach to a given challenge.
 <!--blog paragraph2--> </p>

        <p>Referring to the fixed vs. growth mindset when I'm working can be really helpful when I'm having difficulty with an assignment. One thing that will help me expand the ways I work and think is remembering that taking on these challenges is broadening my understand of this new field, even (or maybe especially) if I have difficulty with that challenge. This helps transform my thinking because instead of viewing struggling with a challenge as a poor reflection of me, I can start viewing difficult challenges as an opportunity to break down some barriers in my learning.
