        <p id="blogp1"> Version control is just a way to keep track of the changes you make to a program. Let’s look at version control through an analogy involving the MOST important contemporary lens; crafting the perfect snapchat. You’re sitting there, minding your own business and BAM, the chance for the perfect snapchat presents itself. Nervously, you open the app, snap a photo, and begin drawing to make the perfect 5 second message for your closest buddies to see. And you’re drawing perfectly, your colors are on point and the picture is looking exactly like you imagined, then the unthinkable happens… You draw the wrong line right across the picture you just took! Fear not, because you don’t have to sacrifice the entire snapchat because of a simple mistake!! Just hit the undo button, finish that perfect drawing, and fire that snapchat off to you buddies. Version control works similarly. As you’re writing code, sometime you realize that a previous version of your code actually worked better or doesn’t have the bug you’re currently trying to fix. You can simply go back in time to a different version of your code and press on from there.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2">Git is a local version control system that allows you to go back to older versions of your work for whatever reason. A keyword here is that git is local, so in order to share code you can simply put it onto a site like GitHub. Here, you can remotely store and look at code because unlike git, GitHub lives remotely.

        <p>GitHub is a great space for working in a (virtual) communal environment. It allows groups to contribute and access work from anywhere, making group work that much easier!!
