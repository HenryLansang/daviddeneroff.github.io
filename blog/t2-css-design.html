        <p id="blogp1">So you’re learning a bit about HTML and CSS and you come across classes and ids. At first, these two seem almost interchangeable; both serve to specifically target an element or group of elements. However, as you progress on you will learn how important it is to know the difference between these two, and there is no better time to learn the difference than early in your studies.<!--blog paragraph1 --></p>
        <p id="blogp2">Ids are unique indicators that are associated with one element. An id cannot be used more than once on a given page or your HTML and CSS won’t be able to figure out which element to target. Imagine you’re a teacher in a room full of students and you need an emergency phone number for a student in case of emergency. That number is very specific and only applies to one particular thing. While working with ids CSS, you must make sure your id is equally unique for the page because you cannot add additional elements to that id. Simply put #id-name in your CSS file and style away!!
 <!--blog paragraph2--> </p>

        <p>Classes work very differently from ids because they can be used on multiple elements and an element can have multiple classes. Back in the classroom, as a teacher you can call out “boys,” to get the attention of a broader group of students. After putting our class name after a period, we can style our .class easily in our CSS file. Additionally, we can style multiple classes the same time by setting off each class .with, .a, .comma. You can specify boys with hats, boys with sneakers, boys with hats and sneakers, and so forth. Instead of telling Mary and Martha, and Julia, and Becca… to do something, you can just have all the girls do something. In CSS terms, this means you can style an incredible volume of material in a few key strokes.
