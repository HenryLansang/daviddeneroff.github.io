  <p>“But wait, that answer doesn’t help me at all” <br>
“Hold on, what are you asking?” <br>
“Think about what you want to say, then try asking me again”</p>
  <p>Have you ever reached out to someone for help, only to become frustrated when they don’t give you the information you need? If you’re not getting a good answer to your question (or even worse, no answer at all), you may have to reconsider how you're asking those questions and evaluate if you can do anything to help your chances of getting a satisfactory response in the future. When you ask a question, you are including someone new into an issue that you are having, so it is really important that you give that person the best possible chance of helping you.</p>
  <p>A well formatted question, particularly regarding code on the internet, requires that the asker phrase the question concisely, highlight the specifics of their issue and why it’s unique, and things that have tried and why those attempts failed. Asking “why doesn’t my ruby method work?” doesn’t prompt the same response as “my ruby method is getting an argument error when …” The greatest part about taking the time to format a question in a way potential responders can understand is it can often help you realize your mistake. When posting questions, I’ve found that going slowly through my issue so that others can understand it actually helps me understand it, and sometimes solve it. Of course this is just a fortunate byproduct of asking a good question, but it does show the value of outlining what happens in each instance of your issue.</p>
  <p>Another important thing to do is put yourself in the place of the person answering your question. A site like StackOverflow is not a paid service from which you can demand answers. The site has people, just like you, taking time out of their day to look at an issue that you’re having. Making sure you take the time to put something into the community in the most productive way is a great means of showing your appreciation for someone taking the time to help you.</p>
  <p>Asking question is extremely important in coding and in life in general. One person cannot possibly contain all the answers, and we have to be able to reach out to others at times to help us, just as we will hopefully help others at times. As such, we must take the time to learn how to ask the most effective questions so we can benefit as much as possible from the input of others.</p>
